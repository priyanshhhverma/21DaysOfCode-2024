You are given an array A[] of N integers. Consider a complete graph of N nodes numbered from 1 to N, 
where the weight of edge connecting nodes x and y (x!=y) is | x * y - A[x] % A[y] - A[y] % A[x] |. 
Your task is to find the cost of the minimum spanning tree of this graph.

The cost of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree. 
There can be many spanning trees. Minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree where the cost is minimum among all the spanning trees.

Input Format

Input: N = 5 A[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 1}
Output: 10
Explanation: One of the minimum spanning tree will be 1 / | \ 2 5 4 / 3

Cost will be weight of edge 1 - 2 + weight of edge 1 - 4 + weight of edge 1 - 5 + weight of edge 2 - 3 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 10

Constraints
1 <= N <= 5*10^4
1 <= A[i] <= N

Output Format

Input: N = 3 A[] = {1, 1, 1}
Output: 5

Explanation: One of the minimum spanning tree will be 1 / \ 3 2

Cost will beweight of edge 1 - 3 + weight of edge 1 - 2 = 2 + 3 = 5
