# Questions for Day 8 – (28/06/2024)
## DSA:
**Question 1:** You have three stacks of cylinders with varying heights. Remove cylinders from the top of the stacks so that all stacks are of the same height, and return this maximum possible height.

##### Inputs:
- Three arrays of integers representing the heights of cylinders in each stack.
##### Output:
•	The maximum possible height where all stacks are equal.
##### Example:
stack1 = [3, 2, 1, 1, 1]

stack2 = [4, 3, 2]

stack3 = [1, 1, 4, 1]

##### Output: 5

**Question 2:** Implement a stack using two queues. The stack should support standard operations like push, pop, and top.
##### Inputs/Outputs:
- Methods for stack operations.
  
Example:

stack.push(1)

stack.push(2)

stack.top()  # Output: 2

stack.pop()  # Output: 2

stack.top()  # Output: 1







## WEB-DEV:


Note: do these exercises in the Console (right-click > Inspect > Console)
           Use a script tag to link an html file with JS.
1.	Use alert(...); to display your name in a popup.
2.	Using math, calculate 10 + 5 - 2 in the Console.
3.	Use document.body.innerHTML = ...; to display your name on the web page.
4.	At a restaurant, you order 1 soup for $10, 3 burgers for $8 each, and 1 ice cream for $5. Use JavaScript to calculate the cost of the order.
5.	At a restaurant, you order 1 coffee ($5), 2 bagels ($3 each), and 1 soup ($9). Calculate the cost and save it in a variable called 'cost'.
