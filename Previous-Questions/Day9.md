## WEB-DEV:


1.	Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day(use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).If hour is between 6 and 12, display 'Good morning!' in the console. If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console. Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console
2.	Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older). Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside. Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console. Note: try to use the || operator in your solution. Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages.
3.	Create an array of numbers: const nums = [10, 20, 30]; Modify the last value in this array and change it to 99.
4.	Create a for loop that counts up from 0 to 10, but counts up by 2 (0, 2, 4, ..., 8, 10).
5.	Create a for loop that counts down from 5 to 0.
